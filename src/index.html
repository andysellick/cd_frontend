	        		<p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance', and the much more popular 'Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I' have to pay 'them'!</p>

	        		<p>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>

	        			<li>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</li>

	        		</ul>
	        		<p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>

	        		<p>And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
	        		<h3>Another, smaller heading</h3>
	        		<p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>

	        		<p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
